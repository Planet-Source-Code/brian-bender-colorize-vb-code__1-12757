## Colorize VB Code


</div>

### Description

This is a routine that colorizes (Highlites) VB syntax (source code). I have been looking for this, but have only found REALLY slow routines so I wrote my own. I know there are tons of code libraries that you guys are writing that lack this. I have been racking the brain to make this faster. Any contributions would be greatly appreciated. I only ask that if you use it you will not remove my name and to vote if you like and use it.
